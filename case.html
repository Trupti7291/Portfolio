                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    myFlix is a web application, a client-side application developed in React, based on its existing
                    server-side code using MERN stack. The application consists of a list of all movies to the user.
                    Users can select a movie for more details(description, genre, director, image).Users are able to
                    create an account, update their personal data, and create a list of favorite movies.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    To create a responsive web application to showcase my skills in full-stack (Front-end and Back-end)
                    development in my professional portfolio.

                </p>
                <br />
                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>
                    The aim of the project was to have an ambitious full-stack project I can add to my professional
                    portfolio. Develop my skills to build the complete server-side and client-side for the application
                    from scratch.

                <h3>Server-Side</h3>
                <p> Created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, that interacts with a non-relational database
                    (MongoDB). The API can be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET or POST. To retrieve data
                    from and store data in the database, CRUD methods are used. The API provides movie information in
                    JSON format.</p>
                <br />
                <p>To test the API, I used Postman. I also included user authentication and authorization code in the
                    form of basic HTTP authentication and JWT authentication.</p>
                <h3>Client-Side</h3>
                <p>After completing the API, I started to build the interface users would need when making requests to,
                    and receiving responses from, the server-side. It is a single-page, responsive application,
                    developed with React and React-Redux. It provides several interface views, including, but not
                    limited to, a main view (shows a list of all movies), single movie view (shows data about a single
                    movie and allows users to add the movie to their list of favorites), a login view, a registration
                    view and a profile view (where users can update their user data and list of favorites).

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>This was both my favorite and most challenging project. I have enjoyed building the API and working
                    with
                    database structures. I also quickly became familiar with using the terminal. Developing the
                    client-side,
                    it took me a while to understand how React and Redux work and how to achieve the desired results.
                    But To solve this challenge, First, I searched google and later sought help from StackOverflow
                    however somehow I did not find the solution. Lastly, I approached my mentor and tuitor to help and
                    after a pair-programming session with an experienced developer, I could conquer that mountain.</p>

            <div class="duration">
                <h2>Duration</h2>
                <p>The development of the client-side took me twice as long as it normally took to complete a
                    CareerFoundry achievement. It was because I needed time to wrap my head around how React (and React
                    Redux) work.
